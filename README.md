# StaticDefaultRouting
This project demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and verify static and default routing for both IPv4 and IPv6 in a multi-router environment. The lab uses two Cisco 4331 routers, two switches, and end devices to build a functional routed network supporting dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) communication.
